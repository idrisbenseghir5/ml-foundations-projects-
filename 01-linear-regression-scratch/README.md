## Description  
This project implements simple linear regression from scratch (without sklearn's LinearRegression class). It covers:  
- Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values).  
- Manual computation of correlation, slope, intercept.  
- Predictions and evaluation (R², SEE, MAE, RMSE).  
- Comparison with scikit-learn.  
- Visualizations (scatter plots, residual plots).  
  
## Dataset:  
`study_hours.csv` (Hours Studied vs. Exam Score).  
  
## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for preprocessing and comparison only).  
  
## How to Run  
1. Ensure `study_hours.csv` is in the same directory.  
2. Open in Jupyter Lab/Notebook: `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.  
3. Run all cells sequentially.  
   
## Results  
- Manual implementation matches scikit-learn closely.  
  
## Limitations  
- Assumes linear relationship; no advanced features like regularization.  
- Small dataset; may not generalize.
