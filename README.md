# Machine Learning Foundations — Implementation Projects
This repository presents a series of machine learning projects developed from first principles using Python , Pandas and NumPy. Each project demonstrates the mathematical concepts and algorithmic logic underlying core machine learning techniques, including regression, classification, clustering, and neural network design.

# Included Projects
1- Linear Regression (from scratch) – Predicting continuous outcomes using gradient descent  
2- Logistic Regression (from scratch) – Implementing binary classification on real-world datasets  
3- K-Means Clustering – Exploring unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction  
4- Simple Neural Network – Constructing a feed-forward neural network for image classification  

# Objectives
Reinforce theoretical understanding of machine learning fundamentals and related mathematical concepts
Develop practical implementation skills through low-level coding  
Build a structured portfolio that demonstrates foundational competency in data science and AI  

# Tools and Technologies
Languages & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Environment: Jupyter Lab
